## Project Overview

This project covers the basics of ES6, which is a significant update to JavaScript that includes new syntax and features. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the ES6 syntax and understand how it improves JavaScript development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Utilize arrow functions
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Implement default parameters in functions
- Understand and use the spread and rest operators
- Destructure objects and arrays
- Utilize enhanced object literals
- Understand the benefits of the ES6 module system

## Environment Setup

To run the code and tests in this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-backend-javascript.git
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x00-ES6_basic
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The project directory contains JavaScript files that demonstrate various ES6 features. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

```
0x00-ES6_basic/
├── 0-constants.js
├── 1-block-scoped.js
├── 2-arrow.js
├── 3-default-parameter.js
├── 4-rest-parameter.js
├── 5-spread-operator.js
├── 6-string-interpolation.js
├── 7-get-object-property.js
├── 8-parameter-reassign.js
└── README.md
```

## Tasks

Each task in this project is designed to practice a specific ES6 feature. Below is a list of tasks with a brief description:

1. **0-constants.js**:
   - Define constants and understand their immutability.
   
2. **1-block-scoped.js**:
   - Learn the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` for block scope.

3. **2-arrow.js**:
   - Use arrow functions and understand their lexical `this`.

4. **3-default-parameter.js**:
   - Implement default parameters in functions.

5. **4-rest-parameter.js**:
   - Use the rest parameter to handle function arguments.

6. **5-spread-operator.js**:
   - Apply the spread operator to arrays and objects.

7. **6-string-interpolation.js**:
   - Utilize template literals for string interpolation.

8. **7-get-object-property.js**:
   - Access object properties using destructuring.

9. **8-parameter-reassign.js**:
   - Understand parameter reassignment and best practices.

## How to Use

To run the JavaScript files and see the output, use the `node` command followed by the file name. For example:

```bash
node 0-constants.js
```

You can also create your own test cases to further explore and understand each feature.
